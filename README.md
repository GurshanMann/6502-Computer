# 6502-Computer
In the **6502 Microcomputer** project, I designed a system with 256kB ROM, 16kB RAM, VIA, and an LCD Module, all on a 1MHz clock. I also created monostable and bistable clock modules using 555 Timer ICs for single-step and variable clock frequencies. The project involved Assembly programming and interfacing with SPI, I2C, and UART protocols.

During the project on the **6502 Microcomputer**, I designed a microcomputer featuring a memory-mapped 256kB ROM, 16kB RAM, and a Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA), all operating on a 1MHz clock. This involved utilizing Assembly language for programming and employing tools like Autodesk Inventor for circuit design. Additionally, I developed both monostable and bistable clock modules using 555 Timer Integrated Circuits (ICs), which enabled functionalities for single-step operations and adjustable clock frequencies. This project provided valuable insights into hardware design and the intricacies of microcontroller programming, as well as practical experience with communication protocols such as SPI, I2C, and UART.
