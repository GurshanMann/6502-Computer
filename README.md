# 6502-Computer
In the **6502 Microcomputer** project, I designed a system with 256kB ROM, 16kB RAM, VIA, and an LCD Module, all on a 1MHz clock. I also created monostable and bistable clock modules using 555 Timer ICs for single-step and variable clock frequencies. The project involved Assembly programming and interfacing with SPI, I2C, and UART protocols.
